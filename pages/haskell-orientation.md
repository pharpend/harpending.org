# #haskell orientation

I noticed newbies to the `#haskell` IRC channel all go through the same cycle of
getting information, and getting yelled at for doing the wrong thing. That is,
there are a number of unwritten rules to the channel, so here they are, written
out.

1.  Please don't ask to ask. What I mean is, don't say something along the lines
    of "I'm having an issue with `$x`, could someone please help me?", unless
    you *immediately* follow by stating your issue.

2.  Since `#haskell` is a channel about a programming language, it's likely the
    case that your issue involves a Haskell program you wrote. Supposing that is
    the case, please paste your code on
    [lpaste.net](http://lpaste.net/new/haskell). If there's something like a
    compiler error, or `cabal`'s doing something funky, also paste the error
    message on lpaste.net.
