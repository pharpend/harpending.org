# Peter Harpending

I'm a mathematics student at the University of Utah in the United States. These
are my rambling things.

## Projects

These are my main projects

* [`dotfiles`][1] - not a real project, but nonetheless actively maintained.
* [*Learn You Some Algebras for Glorious Good!*][lysa] - a math textbook.
* [`puffytools`][puffytools] - a "personal assistant" on the command line.

[puffytools]: https://github.com/pharpend/puffytools

## Also of interest

* [#archlinux orientation][7]
* [#haskell orientation][8]
* [GitHub profile][0]
* [Open Source Report Card][9]
* [Source for this site][6]

## Contact

* The best way to contact me is IRC, my nick is `pharpend` on FreeNode.
* You can also email me at <pharpend2@gmail.com>. I don't check that email very
  often, so IRC is best.
