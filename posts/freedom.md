# The Step-by-Step guide to getting back your digital freedom

Hey, guys! I thought I'd write a step-by-step guide to help you all obtain
digital freedom, and therefore digital privacy.

First of all, what is "digital freedom"? Well, it's the basic idea that you
should be able to do as you please with your software, your electronic devices,
and online.

Most people don't want their digital devices giving away their confidential
data. Thus, part of making your digital things do what you want is making them
not give away your confidential data without your permission. That's called
digital privacy. The only way to get digital privacy is to give yourself digital
freedom.

The path to digital freedom will involve some changes in the way you use your
electronics. You might not like some of these changes. I promise, though, it's
all worth it in the end.

The first step is to secure your presence online. Every day, you are likely
subject to tracking, targeted advertisements, and the sale of your personal
information to people you wouldn't want knowing your name. Moreover, the same
people who profit from selling your information are often forced to hand it over
to the ~~thought police~~ American National Security Agency (NSA), without your
knowledge or permission.  

Even if you don't care about your own privacy, you certainly have friends or
family members that do.  In the interest of being considerate, you should obtain
your digital privacy to protect others who want theirs.

Even if you are super careful, and don't share anything about your
privacy-seeking friends, data about you is used to target those people who
prefer to keep their lives private. (This practice is more commonly known as
"social networking"). It's incredibly unethical, but it is entirely legal (you
all probably just click "Agree" instead of reading the 1200 page document of
Terms & Conditions).

You may not even realize that you are subject to this mistreatment; you may just
think it's business as usual. I'm going to show you exactly what this
mistreatment is, and how to escape it.

Regardless of your political views, I don't know of anyone who wants to hand
over their deepest, darkest secrets to some large company, much less a
government known for blackmail, extortion, and harassment.

# Outline

This section outlines the rest of this document.

There are three basic steps to getting your digital freedom back.

1.  **You are going to quit giving away your information on the internet.**

    This involves closing your accounts on things like Facebook, Google, and
    Tinder. These companies are notorious for selling your confidential
    information in the interest of making money. They also happily hand your
    data over to the NSA.

    You can keep your accounts on services that respect your freedom, such as
    Identi.ca and Twitter. You're only going to delete your accounts on services
    that purposefully violate your freedom.

    In many cases, the alternative services I recommend do cost
    money. **However**: the software I recommend in step 2 does not cost money,
    unlike the software you are likely currently using. Even though you will
    probably be paying more for online services, you will no longer be paying
    for software, so you'll actually save money.

2.  **You are going to quit using software on your computer that violates your
    digital freedom.**

    This is software that tries to control how you use it. Very often, this is
    the same software that the NSA controls, or some large company
    controls. Instead, *you* will control how your computer works. It's quite
    liberating.

    In this process, you'll also make your computer less vulnerable to viruses
    and hackers.

3.  **You are going to quit buying material items that violate your digital
    freedom.**

    This includes: proprietary game consoles with cameras, Blu-ray disks,
    anything made by Apple,

    You don't have to get rid of your current items, this is just for future
    reference. I will show you how to salvage what's left of your freedom on
    your current items.

These three steps are ranked in order of importance. You should go through with
them all. However, gun to your head, the first one is the most important.

Each step has a series of sub steps

##### Step 1: Control your online presence

1.  **You are going to switch over to Mozilla Firefox, and configure it to
    maximize your privacy**

    This involves:

    1.  Enabling the do-not-track feature.
    2.  Considering whether or not you want to enable synchronization, and
        whether or not to use a master password.
    3.  Installing a number of add-ons:

        1. AdBlock Edge
        1. BetterPrivacy
        1. Disconnect
        1. Disconnect Search
        1. Flashblock
        1. HTTPS-Everywhere
        1. NoScript (optional, but recommended)

        **Important:** Do not install the Ghostery add-on in Firefox. Despite
        being supposedly designed to protect your privacy, it is proprietary, so
        it is a security risk.

# Step 1: Control your online presence

This is the first step towards getting your digital freedom back. It's the
easiest step, and it is the most important, hence why it's first.

There are a number of sub-steps


## Step 1.1: Fix your web browser.

[According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers#Summary_table),
anywhere between 80--90% of internet users use browsers that don't respect their
freedom. Here is a list of good and bad browsers:


Good                        Bad                 Ugly
------------------------    -----------------   -----------
Firefox                     Chrome              Jumanji
IceCat                      Chromium            Midori
Tor Browser Bundle (TBB)    Internet Explorer   QuteBrowser
                            Opera               QupZilla
                            Safari              Uzbl
                                                Xombrero
-----------------------------------------------------------

The "ugly" column is for browsers that are technically okay, but are not optimal
(nor are they, in most cases, very pleasant to use).

Of the three "good" browsers, I recommend Firefox, with some extended
configuration, which I will document below. 

IceCat and TBB are both actually much better than what I recommend, as far as
digital freedom and digital privacy go. 

**However**:

*   IceCat blocks anything it deems a threat to your digital freedom. Sometimes,
    it makes mistakes, or you are willing to make an exception. IceCat isn't
    reasonable enough to figure this out, and thus is not very pleasant to use.

* TBB is the most secure option, because it encrypts your connection, and then
    bounces it through dozens of relays throughout the world (it also blocks ads
    and scripts and stuff). Although this practice is very effective at
    anonymizing your connection, the result is a very slow and shaky
    connection. Most people are not willing to deal with this inconvenience, so
    I won't recommend it for the average person.

    Nonetheless, if you need serious privacy, TBB is the best option.

#### Migrating over to Firefox

If you currently use one of the browsers in the "bad" column, you'll want to

#### Configuring Firefox to maximize your privacy

At this point you've installed Firefox on your machine, and migrated your data
over to Firefox. In this step, we're going to configure Firefox in such a manner
that it maximizes your privacy.

First things first, let's go into Firefox's internal settings. Click the triple
bar icon in the top right corner:

![](/images/triple-bar.png)

Then, you'll want to click the "Preferences" button:

![](/images/prefs-button.png)

A window will pop up, which probably looks something like this:

![](/images/prefs-window.png)

Enable your web browser's do-not-track feature:

![](/images/prefs-window-do-not-track.png)

Next, we're going to enable some of Firefox's security settings:

![](/images/prefs-window-security.png)

Make sure to check all of those boxes **except for the last one**, which is "Use
a master password".

You are more than welcome to use a master password. It's a good idea. The master
password encrypts your data. So, even if you use Firefox's sync feature (which I
will show you in a minute), you are the only person who can access it. Even if
Mozilla gave your data over to the NSA, the NSA wouldn't be able to do anything
with it.

However, if you forget your master password, then your data is lost forever. Not
even the NSA can break this encryption.
